writing: Orestia (458 BC)
=========================

:: Title
Oresteia

:: Date
458 BC

:: Description
The Oresteia (Ancient Greek: Ὀρέστεια) is a trilogy of Greek tragedies written
by Aeschylus in the 5th century BC, concerning the murder of Agamemnon by
Clytemnestra, the murder of Clytemnestra by Orestes, the trial of Orestes, the
end of the curse on the House of Atreus and the pacification of the Erinyes.
The trilogy—consisting of Agamemnon (Ἀγαμέμνων), The Libation Bearers
(Χοηφóρoι), and The Eumenides (Εὐμενίδες)—also shows how the Greek gods
interacted with the characters and influenced their decisions pertaining to
events and disputes. The only extant example of an ancient Greek theatre
trilogy, the Oresteia won first prize at the Dionysia festival in 458 BC. The
principal themes of the trilogy include the contrast between revenge and
justice, as well as the transition from personal vendetta to organized
litigation. Oresteia originally included a satyr play, Proteus (Πρωτεύς),
following the tragic trilogy, but all except a single line of Proteus has been
lost.

:: Choice Themes
killing wicked people [The social ethical dilemma at the heart of the story is whether a man may justly slay his own mother if she has killed his father. One argument against this was that husband and wife don't share blood whereas mother and son do; a counter argument was that a mother is merely a crucible for the father's seed and thus deserve far less loyalty from her offspring than do the father.]

:: Major Themes
matricide [The point of the story was to debate whether Orestes' slaying of his own mother could possibly be justified.]
spouse murder [The story concerned the murder of Agamemnon by Clytemnestra.]
the desire for vengeance [Electra and Orestes wanted to avenge their father Agamemnon's murder at the hands of Clytemnestra.]
the desire for justice [Apollo in particular was concerned with seeing justice visited on Clytemnestra; the Furies were keen on seeing Orestes suffer justice (as they saw it) for committing matricide.]
Ancient Greek mythology [Apollo, Athena, and the Furies made explicit appearances in part 3 and the morality of Orestes crime was debated with reference to things the Gods had done.]
mother and son [Clytemnestra and Orestes; Orestes occasionally reflected on his relationship to her]

:: Minor Themes
brother and sister [Orestes and Electra]
husband and wife [Agamemnon and Clytemnestra]
mother and daughter [Clytemnestra]

Terence's plays to be performed post-antiquity, in Florence in 1476. It was
adapted by Machiavelli, whose Andria was likewise the author's first venture
into playwriting, and was the first of Terence's plays to be translated into
English ca. 1520. The second English translation was by the Welsh writer
Morris Kyffin in 1588.

fatherly disappointment in a son [Simo was upset at his son Pamphilus' behavior regarding Glycerium, and later for perceived lying and scheming.]
infatuation [Pamphilus and Glycerium were besotted with each other.]
master and slave [The story much concerned the scheming or perceived scheming of slaves, esp. Davus, to manipulate their masters. Simo and his slave Sosia (latterly a freedman). Charinus and his slave Byrrhia. Pamphilus and his slave Davus.] {FD could parent this to master and servant but reluctant to merge}
choosing between love and family [Pamphilus was torn between his love for Glycerium and his duty to his father.]
arranged marriage [Central to the story was that Simo had arranged a marriage for Pamhpilus that Pamphilus didn't care for. Chremes arranged two marriages for his daughters (Glycerium being deemed his in the end).]
friendship [Charinus was dismayed by the rumors that his dear friend Pamphilus was in love with the very girl whom Charinus fancied. Simo and his old friend Chremes came into conflict what should have been a routine arranged marriage between Simo's son and Chremes' daughter.]
romantic infidelity [There was a scandalous rumor going around that ]

father and daughter [Chremes and his daughter Philumena.]

keeping secrets [Mysis agree to keep secret Pamphilus' impending wedding ceremony from his lover Glycerium on account that news of the event might too much for the pregnant Glycerium to take.]
miserliness [Davus apparently reluctantly told Simo that he Simo had a reputation for being tight with his money.]
mimetic desire [Charinus said "It was only after I told you I loved her that you took a fancy to her" to Pamphilus in regard to Charinus' love interest Philumena.] {PS: The earliest occurrence of this desire in extant fiction?}
class prejudice in society [Simo disapproved over his son, Pamphilus, dallying with a woman of such apparent low birth as Glycerium, who it seemed was the sister of a harlot.]


writing: The Self-Tormentor (163 BC)
====================================

:: Title
The Self-Tormentor

:: Date
163 BC

:: Description
Heauton Timorumenos (Ἑαυτὸν τιμωρούμενος, Greek for The Self-Tormentor) is a play written in Latin by Terence (Latin: Publius Terentius Afer), a dramatist of the Roman Republic, in 163 BC. The play has presented academics with some problems. Firstly it is not entirely clear whether Heauton Timorumenos is Terence's second or third play. More importantly, due to the scant survival of Menander's play of the same name, there is no simple way to judge how much of Terence's version is translation and how much is invention. It is set in a village in the countryside of Attica.
